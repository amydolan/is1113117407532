        example of Software as a Service. Salesforce produces cloud-based applications for sales and marketing among other areas. The 
        attractiveness of Salesforce for firms comes from the idea that the service doesnt require IT experts to set up or manage. Salesforce

        <!--Information on Amazon as IaaS with link-->
        
        <p><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong> - Amazon (AWS)</p>
        <p>Techopedia.com sites the definition of IaaS as being a service model that delivers computer infrastructure on an outsourced 
        basis to support enterprise operations. The page furthers this by saying that IaaS typically provides hardware, storage, servers 
        and date center space along with the possibility of software. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is also known as Hardware as a
        Service (HaaS). Gartner named Amazon (AWS) as the leader in the IaaS Sector for the 7th Consecutive year last June. Amazon is an 
        example of IaaS as a result of many of its services including Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Block Store and Autoscaling. According 
        to Techrepublic.com, AWS has more than double the market share of its next 9 IaaS competitors combined.</p>

        <!--Information on Gmail as CaaS with link-->
        <p><strong>Communication as a Service (CaaS)</strong> - Gmail</p>
        <p>Communications as a service (CaaS) is a collection of different vendor services that facilitate business communications, according
        to Techopedia.com. Organisations may use these and similar services to lower costs and increase efficiency for business processes involving audio 
        or video telecommunications. Wihtout a doubt, Gmail fits very well into this category. Gmail is used by firms all over the world, along with 
        people using it fo their own personal communication needs and not just for work. Gmail gives an employee the opportunity to communicate with 
        co-workers sitting beside them and co-workers sitting at a desk on the opposite side of the globe. With the option of email, instant messaging
        and many more, Gmail has certainly made its mark as CaaS.</p>
