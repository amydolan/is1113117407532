            <div class="section" id="section1"><h3>What is Cloud Computing?</h3><br/>
            According to the Microsoft Azure website, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—servers, storage, databases, networking, software, 
            analytics and more—over the Internet (“the cloud”). Companies offering these computing services are called cloud providers and typically charge for 
            cloud computing services based on usage, similar to how you are billed for water or electricity at home. The growth of cloud computing in the last
            number of years has been astronomical and this is due to the huge number of advantages available to those who utilise cloud services to the full potential.

        	<div class="section" id="section2"><h3>Why the cloud?</h3><br/>
        	Personally, I am a massive advocate for cloud services because of the way it makes content so accessible from anywhere. Take this project for example, I work
        	on this in the labs in college and my work is saved exactly as I left it so that I can work on it again when I get home. We use cloud computing on a day 
        	to day basis whether we realise it or not. Fresh Consulting named Spotify as Pioneers in Cloud Technology, an app many people rely on heavily for their music. You 
        	have access to millions of different songs and artists without having to take up storage on your device. An app/site many of us are familiar with is also one of 
        	the most important cloud computing companies as named by Network World is Netflix. Social media is a prime example of people choosing to use cloud services.
